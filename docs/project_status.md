<summary><strong>✅ Completed Features</strong></summary>

- **Curation Strategy (v2.1):**
  - **Foreign Language Filter:** Strict `en` filter with exceptions for Global Hits (>2,000 votes).
  - **Data Enrichment:** Added Directors and Top 5 Cast for all 4,721 movies.
  - **3-Layer Curation:** Cable Canon + Cultural Reach Scorer + Dedup.
  - Final pool: **4,721 movies** (Quality > Quantity).
- **Core Game Loop:**
  - Swipe left/right logic (Tinder-style).
  - "Seen" / "Not Seen" / "Skip" actions.
  - Undo functionality with state restoration.

### UI / UX
- **Enriched Cards:** Back of card now shows Director and Cast.
- High-performance "Sliding Window" card stack (60 fps).
- Dynamic "Time Travel" theming (80s Synthwave → 2020s Modern).

### Data Persistence
- LocalStorage support for saving progress.
- QR Code export/import logic (cross-device sync).

### Gamification
- Streak tracking and "Fire" mode.
- Ranks and Milestone celebrations (Confetti).

### Infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.
- Automated generation scripts: `fetch` → `build` → `enrich`.

<summary><strong>🧠 Lessons Learned</strong></summary>

### Data Quality vs. Quantity
- **The "Deep Trawl" Trap:** Broad searches (`/discover/movie`) return high volume but low metadata quality (missing credits).
- **Solution:** A targeted "Enrichment" pass (`/movie/{id}/credits`) is necessary for high-value apps, even if it takes longer to run.

### Algorithmic Curation
- **Language Bias:** Raw popularity sorts bring in niche regional hits (e.g., French TV movies) that clutter a global "pop culture" list.
- **The "Global Hit" Proxy:** Using `vote_count > 2000` proved an effective proxy for identifying foreign films that crossed over into the mainstream (e.g., *Parasite*, *Spirited Away*).

### UI Resilience
- **Nested Data:** Always verify data structure depth (`movie.credits.cast` vs `movie.cast`).
- **Fail-safes:** UI components must gracefully handle missing metadata (null checks for Directors/Runtime).
